# MyReadGoal

>Those are my technical and non-technical reading goals.

I created this repository to share my readings over each year (from 2015) and a way to encourage me to achieve this goal.

If you want to indicate me a book to read, open an issue with the title: "I indicate: Book Name" and in the comments tell me why you indicate me this book and other information.

Please feel free to fork this repository and create your own reading goal :smiley:
